# where-I-dump-mycpp
the title said it all

This is a repository, where I'll dump all(if not most) my c++ project, and of-course with the set of improving my own standard of programming to write a nice, an understandable variable name, good commentary and also with the a target for improvement for it to be a minimal usage of memory and improve the program performance.

This is for myself. If you find this to a liking, considered to look at my code, and critics my code, so that I can improve myself even more.
