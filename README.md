# where-I-dump-mycpp
the title said it all

This is a repository, where I'll dump all my c++ project, but of-course with the target of improving my own standard to write an nice, understandable variable name, commentary and also with the target to improve it to a minimal usage of memory and improve the program performance.

This is for myself. If you find this to a liking, considered to look at my code, and critics my code, so that I can improve myself even more.
