# Explaining for-Loop

// as you should know that for loop are a counter-loop, and can't be a sentinel-loop(this I am not to sure about, but I'll look up for it as this is just what I know)

as in C++ for loop would look like the this:-
```cpp
for(int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
    // inside for-loop
}
```

based on:-
``for(initial; condition; updates)``

What is **initial**?
``Initial is a variable that you need to initial /// and it should be a relevant to the condition given.``

What is **condition**?
``condition is the looping condition that would check if the condition is true it would run the code inside of the looping.``

What is **updates**?
``updates is to update the variable that you need to make the looping goes to the objective of the **condition**``

To make you not confuse just stop thinking about the above, and you need to know that for-loop is related to counter//counting

Because it is related to counter/counting it means the loop will looping like a counter.

I'll just give you a sample of for-loop, to make you understand ;-;.

``# 1``
```cpp
for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
    //
}
```
